            <p>
              There is a risk of losing money when it comes to investing, do your due diligence and research before jumping
              into investments. Here are a few nuggets of wisdom to always keep in mind when investing.

            </p>

            <ul class="text-danger">
              <li>Do not invest more than you can lose</li>
              <li>Ensure that you have a rainy day fund, sufficient for at least 6 months of expenses before investing</li>
              <li>Investing is a slow journey, do not chase unnecessary risk for a chance of a windfall. Otherwise, it is gambling.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Lastly, we are just students and not qualified financial advisors, we will only provide information regarding
              <b>how</b> and <b>why</b> to invest, and not the <b>what</b> and <b>when</b> to invest in.</p>
            <div class="line"></div>

            <h3>Know thy basics</h3>
            <p>
              With the disclaimer out of the way, why should one invest? What even is investing? Simply explained, is it when
              one allocates capital to purchase stocks and have their stocks appreciate or receive dividends. Investing
              is the way to get higher returns than placing it in a safe savings
              account. In fact, saving accounts can afford to give you interests is because they themselves invest
              the deposited money in the market, and gives a cut of it back to the depositors. <br><br>
              "Then why shouldn't I just invest everything instead of placing it in banks?" <br><br>
              Well you could, but you are taking on more risk for the higher returns. If you have all your money invested into a
              stock, and suddenly need the money for whatever reason, you are forced to sell off your stock at whatever price it may be, even
              if you incur a loss. Hence, it is important to ensure that all your immediate expenses are covered for, and you have an
              existing rainy day fund as well for when, to put it crudely, s**t hits the fan so that you can weather the storm. <br><br>
              Suppose all of that is covered, why invest then?

            <h5>The magic of compounding and holding for the long-term </h5>
            Pictures speak a thousand words ->
            <img style="width:40%;"src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61d3b06c6a18b7f0babe57bc/6200de733b2d3a6a5ded4011_7bb27629-88d1-41e2-bb1a-1c4d5f931b07_savings-vs-investments-over-40-years%2B2.jpeg">
            <p>Using hypothetical interest rates, 2% vs 7% might not seem like much, especially on small amounts like
              $200. Only a $5 difference. However, you proceed to earn that 5% difference on the earned interest in the year
            following that, and so on so forth... eventually the difference is very noticeable. Notice that the graph for
            investing isn't smooth, with noticeable drops and peaks, correlating to financial boons and dooms. This is why investing for the long-term is often
            touted as being better than short term day-trading (especially for those without investing know hows), as holding
            over long periods of time tends to average out both positive returns and negative returns to be roughly 8%-10%. As the old saying goes,
            <b>time in market is better than timing the market.</b></p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <h3>Know thy self</h3>
            <p>Are you able to sleep at night knowing that your stock could fall by 10% or even more the next day? Or are you able to shrug
            it off? Knowing what your risk appetite is will help you to decide what kinds of investment vehicles you are more suited for and your
            portfolio make up (not covered by us). If your stock doubles in price, will you sell or hold on in case there is further increase in price?
            What if it dips? At what point do you cut losses and sell your stock? Knowing your entry and exit points can help to reduce investing
            risks as well.</p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <h3>Know thy platforms</h3>
            <p>After knowing a bit about yourself, and the whys behind investing, now comes the "how" part. With the introduction of trading apps, there are
              many options for you to try out. To purchase stocks, simply deposit money to your chosen platform (or broker), select a particular stock or Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) that you wish to
              purchase, and just set a buy order with a specified quantity and price and wait for your order to be fulfilled, easy as that. To sell, simply set a sell order with a quantity and price
            that you are willing to sell at, and wait as well. Note that just because you request to buy or sell at a certain price, does not guarantee that someone will sell or buy at that price, so set your
            requested dollar amount reasonably! Here are some possible platforms for you to begin your investing journey.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Tiger Brokers</li>
              <li>Moo Moo</li>
              <li>Your local banks</li>
              <li>and many more!</li>
              </ul>

              What are some things to consider?
            <ul>
              <li>Commissions: What are the fees that you need to pay when transacting using their platform?</li>
              <li>Markets: Ensure that the platform you use supports the markets that you want to invest in. For instance, certain apps do not support SG-based stocks.</li>
              <li>Trustworthiness: Is the platform likely to go bankrupt? </li>
              <li>UI and features: Some platforms have many features tailored for the experienced user which can be intimidating, whilst others might be more newbie friendly. </li>
            </ul>
