Note to self: IMPT SQL COMMANDS
USE {database name}
SHOW TABLES
SELECT \* FROM {table}
SHOW COLUMNS in {table}

NOTE TO SELF:
Hosting a website on google cloud:

-create a compute engine instance

-get the ip address of the instance

-make the ip address static by reserving it

-Go to cloud services > cloud DNS, create zone. Enter any zone name. For DNS name, enter the domain name without any prefix, e.g. example.com and not www.example.com (need to have a DNS name beforehand)

Current issues:

1. To create DB and tables for comments and link it to the app

2b. Create database of comments for each subtopic and link code with database

3. COME UP WITH CONTENT!!!!

4. Make icon and change website name
